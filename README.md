# scrabble_helper
got sick of losing to my family in scrabble :< 

creates a list of words + their scrabble values out of an inputted string of letters, listed in order of scrabble value

## Usage
requires python 3 and Sympy to help with some permutation generation. 

run scrabblehelper.py -> type in your scrabble letters -> read outcomes -> repeat

## Credits

uses words_alpha.txt from this repo: https://github.com/dwyl/english-words to verify words (not perfect for scrabble but close enough)

## Todo (maybe) 

more intense 'real-word' vetting process.
